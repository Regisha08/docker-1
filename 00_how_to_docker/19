# 19. Launch a container name Abathur. It will be a Python container, 2-slim version,
# its /root folder will be bound to a HOME folder on your host, and its 3000 port
# will be bound to the 3000 port of your virtual machine.
# You will personalize this container so that you can use the Flask micro-framework
# in its latest version. You will make sure that an html page displaying "Hello World"
# with <h1> tags can be served by Flask. You will test that your container is
# properly set up by accessing, via curl or a web browser, the IP address of your
# virtual machine on the 3000 port.
# You will also list all the necessary commands in your repository.

#I alredy have a Python image on the computer
#Just name the container as Abathur

docker run --name Abathur -v ~/:/root -p 3000:3000 -dit python:2-slim
docker exec Abathur pip install Flask

#if above doest work then remove the container by "docker rm Abathur"
#and then use -it -d to the first command "docker run -it -d --name Abathur -p 3000:3000 -v ~/:/root python:2-slim"

#exec - Run a command in a running container Abathur
#we are inside of the Abathur cnontainer and we need to install Flask by using command pip install
