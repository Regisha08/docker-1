# 19. Launch a container name Abathur. It will be a Python container, 2-slim version,
# its /root folder will be bound to a HOME folder on your host, and its 3000 port
# will be bound to the 3000 port of your virtual machine.
# You will personalize this container so that you can use the Flask micro-framework
# in its latest version. You will make sure that an html page displaying "Hello World"
# with <h1> tags can be served by Flask. You will test that your container is
# properly set up by accessing, via curl or a web browser, the IP address of your
# virtual machine on the 3000 port.
# You will also list all the necessary commands in your repository.

#I alredy have a Python image on the computer
#Just name the container as Abathur



docker run -d -it -p 3000:3000 --name Abathur --volume ~/:/root python:2-slim && \

#if above doest work then remove the container by "docker stop Abathur && docker rm Abathur"

#exec - Run a command in a running container Abathur
#we are inside of the Abathur cnontainer and we need to install Flask by using command pip install

#by using next command we create a file hello.py by using "echo 'here_shuld_be_python_the_code_inside_of_the_file' > file_name.py"



#to change the host get the ip by using "docker inspect -f "{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}" Abathur"
#to run the Flask and the Abathour container with hello.py file:
#172.17.0.3 its gonna be the ip

#type the ip + :8081 as url in browser (ex: http://192.168.99.102:3000/)
