# 14. Launch a wordpress container as a background task, just for fun. The container
# should be named lair, its 80 port should be bound to the 8080 port of the virtual
# machine, and it should be able to use the spawning-pool container as a database
# service. You can try to access lair on your machine via a web browser, with the
# IP address of the virtual machine as a URL.
# Congratulations, you just deployed a functional Wordpress website in two commands!

# docker pull wordpress

docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name lair --link spawning-pool wordpress

#--link - to link container to contaner(database)
#How to check if all th e above works:
# docker-machine ip docker
#(get the ip adrress)
#go to browser
#type the ip + :8080 as url in browser (ex: http://192.168.99.101:8080/)
