# everything you need to compile C source code and push it onto a git repo (of
# course, make sure before that the package manager and the packages already in the
# container are updated). For this exercise, you should only specify the commands
# to be run directly in the container.

docker pull debian  && docker run -it debian

#do this commands in debian shell to install git:
apt-get update  && apt-get upgrade  && apt-get install git -y
