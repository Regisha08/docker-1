# 6. Launch an nginx container, available on Docker Hub, as a background task. It
# should be named overlord, be able to restart on its own, and have its 80 port
# attached to the 5000 port of Char. You can check that your container functions
# properly by visiting
# http://<ip-de-char>:5000 on your web browser.

docker pull nginx && docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name overlord --restart=always nginx

#-d for the background
#-p for the port
#https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/
#Check if it works : get the ip with "docker-machine ip Char"
#copy the ip + :5000 (ex: http://192.168.99.101:5000/)
